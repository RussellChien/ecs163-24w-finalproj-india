# ECS163 Final Project: India's Economic Growth Seen through Data

## Overview
This project utilizes D3.js to visualize data through various charts and plots, including line graphs, bar charts, and parallel coordinates plots. The visualizations focus on different economic indicators for India, aiming to provide insights into trends over time.

## Functionalities
### Line Graphs
The graph displays GDP versus the selected indicator. Users can select different indicators from a dropdown menu to dynamically update the line graph. The graph automatically updates its axis labels based on the selected indicator and shows an animation of the line graph being created. 
### Bar Charts
The bar chart allows for a view of each indicator over time, including GDP. Users can select an indicator from a dropdown menu, and the chart updates to show the values for that indicator over time. The chart also features tooltips - hovering over a bar displays a tooltip with detailed information about the year, the value of the selected indicator, and significant events related to the indicator, if applicable.
### Parallel Coordinates Plot
Multi-dimensional Analysis: This plot enables the analysis of multiple indicators simultaneously. It provides a holistic view of how different economic indicators interrelate. Users can interact with the plot by clicking on data lines to filter data, enhancing the exploration of data subsets.

## User Instructions
### Line Graphs:
Select an indicator from the dropdown menu adjacent to the line graph. The graph will update to display the trend for the selected indicator versus GDP. 
### Bar Charts:
Choose an indicator from the dropdown menu above the bar chart. The chart will refresh to illustrate the annual data for the chosen indicator. </br>
Hover over individual bars to see tooltips with more information about that year's value and notable related events.
### Parallel Coordinates Plot:
Interact with the plot by clicking data lines to highlight data. This action allows focusing on specific data points and examining how different indicators vary together.
